                            <p><strong>Dr Shawetamberi</strong> is worried about her 85-year-old mother-in-law who is at a big risk of catching the infection if she carries the virus home.

While the senior members understand her profession, her small kids do not want her to go out after they watched some scary Coronavirus videos being shared on social media. "My parents have been supportive. My kids are anxious though," she said.
